      What are “Cookies”?
      </H3>
      <P>
      A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for tracking and record-keeping purposes. Cookies alone cannot be used to identify you as they never contain personal information such as name and email address. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, we will drop cookies as soon as you visit the Services or as soon as you are taken to a specific item on a third party merchant ("Heartface Partner") website. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our website. For example, we use this data to understand how you interact with the Services we can make improvements to the information and design of the Services. By agreeing to the terms of this Cookie Policy, you consent to the cookies referenced above being dropped onto your machine.
      </P>
      <H3>
      What type of cookies do we use and why?
      </H3>
      <P>
      When you visit Heartface’s websites, mobile applications and any other platforms Heartface owns or controls and makes available to you (collectively, the "Services"), we may use cookies or other similar industry-wide technologies to collect and store certain information on your computer. By doing so, we will be able to distinguish you from other users of our Services and enable automatic activation of certain features, in order to provide you with better customer experience (such as to remember what’s in your online basket without you having to put the items in your basket again). It is easy to change your cookie setting. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies your online experience with the Services may be affected.
